# One Drop Test - Notes

## Running This App

I've removed my CONSUMER_KEY and CONSUMER_SECRET; you should add yours to strings.xml before running the app.

## Tests

In the interest of time, I only wrote Android tests for one class. In a real project, all of the classes would have some level of coverage and combination of pure JUnit, Android instrumentation tests, and functional tests.
